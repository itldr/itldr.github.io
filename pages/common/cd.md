# cd

Let's say this is a long, long piece of shell code.

```shell
echo "This is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, 
very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, 


very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, 

very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long piece of code."
```

Let's say this is a very long command.

`echo "It was a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long command."`





```shell 
fdasf
```
